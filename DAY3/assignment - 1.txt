	d. Find out more details  about "Event Loops" in node js 
	   The event loop is a fundamental concept in Node.js that allows it to perform non-blocking I/O operations. It continuously checks the call stack and the event queue for tasks to execute. When the call stack is empty, the event loop checks if there are any tasks in the event queue, if so, it moves them to the call stack for execution.

    - let is a keyword introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) for declaring variables.
    - The main difference between var and let is their scope: var has function scope or global scope, while let has block scope. This means variables declared with var are accessible throughout the function in which they are declared, while variables declared with let are only accessible within the block they are declared in.
