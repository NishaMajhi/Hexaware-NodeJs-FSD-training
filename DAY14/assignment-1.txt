1. what is mocha, chai and chai-http?
	"Mocha," "Chai," and "Chai-HTTP" are all related to testing in JavaScript.

Mocha: Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.

Chai: Chai is an assertion library for Node.js and browsers that can be delightfully paired with any testing framework. It provides a rich set of assertions, which makes your tests easier to read and your test suite more expressive.

Chai-HTTP: Chai-HTTP is a plugin for Chai that provides a set of helpers for asserting HTTP responses when using the HTTP client in Node.js. It allows you to easily make assertions about HTTP responses such as status codes, headers, and response bodies in your tests.
